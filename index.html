							<h2>Papa's Childhood</h2>
							<p>Growing up, Papa was a rough kid. He got several injuries and got into many fights but was still somehow really really smart. At age 15 he was given a national award and he went on to study at MS University in Vadodra. He was some what of a cool kid I guess you could say because just look at the pictures. If he didn't go into engineering he could have gone into modeling for sure.</p>

							<h2>Mama's Childhood</h2>
							<p>We discussed papa's childhood but now it's time to discuss mama's. Mama was NOT rough at all. She never argued with anyone and just focused on her studies. This is why she had many opportunities but due to external circumstances she majored in Math at Mithibai College in Mumbai. Two completely different people from two completely different cities. Who would have guessed that these two would Marry each other.</p>

							<h2>The iconic meeting</h2>
							<p>This meeting is iconic but also something that shouldn't be discussed outside the family(which is why I didn't publish this website lol). Basically Mama and Papa met each other and everything was going great but then they had an argument. IMAGINE LOL they really argued on the first meeting but since these two had families that knew how to control a situation it became chill.</p>

						<h2>The Wedding</h2>
						<p>The wedding wasn't really that much of a big deal honestly it was just a normal wedding. From what I've heard the only real big thing that happened was that papa pulled out a sword during the wedding. The thing is according to the Rajputs, if you pull a sword out of the case, it can't go back in without blood on it so papa cut his hand and then put it back in.</p>
